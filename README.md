## How It Detects Arcane Surge
- **Finds the correct action bar slot** based on the Arcane Surge spell texture (`Interface\\Icons\\INV_Enchant_EssenceMysticalLarge`).
- Uses **`IsUsableAction(actionSlot)`** to determine if the spell is clickable (procced).
- Listens for **`CHAT_MSG_SPELL_SELF_DAMAGE`** to detect when **your spells are resisted** (which procs Arcane Surge).
- Checks for **`COMBAT_TEXT_UPDATE`** with `"SPELL_ACTIVE"` to confirm activation.
- Tracks **`GetActionCooldown(actionSlot)`** to update cooldown progress.

---

## Customization
If Arcane Surge is **not automatically detected**, manually set the **action bar slot** inside the Lua file:
```lua
local actionSlot = 12 -- Change this to your Arcane Surge slot
```

## Known Issues & Future Improvements
- **‚ùó Icon doesn't track activation if the spell is not placed on the action bar.**
- **üîß Improve detection for multiple spell resists triggering Arcane Surge.**
- **‚öôÔ∏è Add an option to customize bar colors and sizes.**
